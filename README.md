Inspired by the idea from the book "Time Wise" paraphrased as "Humans are more complicated than code but machines have documentation and humans do not". You can see the full template ![here](https://www.amantha.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Operating-Model-v0_2.pdf)

### How Should People Best Communicate With You?

I am about to start experimenting with wearing foam based ear plugs at work. If I can't hear a polite bid for my attention, try gesturing in my peripheral vision. You can also get me with the default work messenger platform, or email. 

### What do People Misunderstand About You (at work)?

The most pressing issue is how experiences from other research jobs still effect me now. I have been in a few research projects that crashed before publication and for this reason:

* I prefer research projects that aim for newer journals journals that reduce the solo scientists work burden of completing a publication in any of several different ways. 

* Journals that are orientated towards the code effort and expect less word length: Journal of Open Source Software (JOSS).

* Journals that support executable documents: Next journal.

* Journals that review pre-prints: ELife.

* Open source code and data that I can take anywhere.

* I prefer a non Python programming language. The language I chose as an alternative has a reputation for extravagance, but I just wanted a faster alternative to Python (development time/execution time). Pertaining to past research experiences I needed a language that doesn't remind me of wasted efforts, this final point may not be rational but its an accurate reflection of my situation.

<summary>About Me (personality)  </summary>

- âš¡ Fun facts: Bottle nose dolphins can rest one brain hemisphere at a time. Elephants have a large hippocampus (a structural determinant of good memory). Although octopus are largely cannibalistic, some species still give social living a go. Hippocampus is latin for sea-horse. Orca are also dolphins (toothed whales).

- ðŸ‘¯ I am looking to collaborate on Julia spiking neuron model optimization.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about computational neuroscience and favorite one line hacks.  
- Iâ€™m currently working on all types of data driven neuron model optimization. 
- ðŸŒ±ðŸ¤” I am learning multiple dispatch, syntactic expressions.

 
I thrive on social coding, and I often read about how to better foster team synergy and make the most of professional relationships.

I am a postdoctoral researcher at the International Centre for Neuromorphic Systems, The MARCS Institute for Brain, Behaviour and Development, Western Sydney University. In 2021 I completed a PhD in Computational Neuroscience from Arizona State University, where I focused on gradient-free data-driven optimization of single spiking neuronal models. During my PhD, I also contributed to a volunteer research project, where I converted a closed source project science project to using an open-source methodology. Currently, I am developing network models and spiking network algorithms in Python and Julia.

I have been practicing social coding in some form since 2014 (9 years).
